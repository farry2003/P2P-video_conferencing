# farry2003-P2P-video_conferencing
A server less peer-to-peer video conferencing and file sharing software built using Javascript and 
entirely in- browser client-side code

#Methodology:
We will use webRTC (cutting edge web technology for peer-to-peer communication) for file transfer.
This will be entirely web based so no platform specific code required, just open with browser and share with it.
This will also include the video chat feature between the users. So as to specify the connectivity across the devices.
